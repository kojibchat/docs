# üìù Goverance

Kojib uses a decentralized governance system to allow users to have a say in the future of the platform.&#x20;

This is achieved through the use of Kojib tokens, which are used to give users voting rights and to create proposals to update or change the protocol.&#x20;

Every users tokens are use to vote on proposals, and the proposals with the most votes are put into action.&#x20;

This system ensures that the platform remains open to user feedback and is constantly evolving to meet the needs of its users.&#x20;

Additionally, the tokens are also used as a reward system, incentivizing users to participate in the platform and helping to ensure its continued growth and development.
