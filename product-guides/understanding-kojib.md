# ðŸ“Ž Understanding Kojib

Kojib is a secure and private messaging platform that allows users to communicate with each other without fear of being spied on. It is a decentralized platform, meaning it does not rely on any single server, making it more secure and resilient against attacks. Kojib uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that no one else can access your messages or data. The platform also provides a variety of features, including group chat, file sharing, audio/video calls, and more, making it the perfect way to stay connected with people from all around the world and share your thoughts, ideas, and experiences.

Kojib uses a peer-to-peer network to route messages from one user to another. This network is composed of nodes, which are computers that are running the Kojib protocol. These nodes are used to relay messages between users, ensuring that messages are securely delivered even if the sender and receiver are on different networks. The network also allows Kojib to be resilient against attacks, as messages can still be sent and received even if some nodes are unavailable.

Kojib also uses a public-key cryptography system to ensure secure communication between users. Each user has a unique public key that is used to encrypt messages, and a private key that is used to decrypt them. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the messages, and that no one else can intercept or read them.

Finally, Kojib also provides end-to-end encryption for all messages sent through the platform. This means that messages are encrypted on the sender's device before being transmitted to the recipient, and are only decrypted on the recipient's device. This ensures that no one else can access the messages or data, even if they are intercepted in transit.
